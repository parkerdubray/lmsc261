'''Walking in the door
Light shining, make your hair curl
Wanted to be near you
Want to hurt myself, wanna hear you
Dust falling in the god ray
Time moving, want it both ways

[Chorus]
Choose what you think you need
If I don't know now
Will my instinct be good?
Be good? Be good?
Be good?

[Verse 2]
Feel the earth wrap around me
Feel the days stretch out, steal what could be
See the good, see your company
See the fire eager to burn me
Walking in the door
Light shining, make your hair curl

[Chorus]
Choose what you think you need
If I don't know now
Will my instinct be good?
Be good? Be good?
Be good? Be good?
Be good? Be good?
Be good? Be good?
Be good? Be good?
Be good? Bе good?
Be good? Be good?'''
